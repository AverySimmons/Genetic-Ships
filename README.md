### Description:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A genetic learning project where a population of ray casting ships must fly to a point without colliding. Each ship has 5 short rays that it casts in front of it, then it takes the lengths of those rays along with the local position of the target point and uses them as inputs for its neural network. The neural network produces a single output that controls the rotation of the ship.
