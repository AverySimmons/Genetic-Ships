### Description:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A genetic learning project where a population of ray casting ships must fly to a point without colliding. Each ship has 5 short rays that it casts in front of it, then it takes the lengths of those rays along with the local position of the target point and uses them as inputs for its neural network. The neural network produces a two outputs, one controling the roation speed and direction of the ship and the other controlling its forward velocity. All the game, neural network, and genetic learning logic of this project where build from the ground up in C.
